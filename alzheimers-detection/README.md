# Alzheimer's Detection Machine Learning Application

## Project Overview
This application uses advanced machine learning techniques to assist in early detection of Alzheimer's disease through medical imaging and cognitive assessment analysis.

## Features
- Early Alzheimer's detection using ML models
- Support for multiple data input types
- Interpretable AI predictions
- User-friendly interface

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- GPU recommended (CUDA-enabled)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Core machine learning code
- `data/`: Dataset storage
- `models/`: Trained model artifacts
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `frontend/`: User interface components

## Usage
```bash
# Run prediction model
python src/predict.py

# Launch web interface
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

## Ethical Considerations
- This is a supportive tool, not a definitive medical diagnosis
- Results should always be confirmed by medical professionals
- Patient data privacy is paramount
